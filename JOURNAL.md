This is my journal of the design and building process of **Al-Jazari**.

## 10/8/2025 - Finally decided what to build after hours of thinking (hard)  

After approximately 17 cups of tea, 4 existential crises, one deep sigh at my 100+ open tabs (yes, my browser is basically a war zone), and about 2 billion messages exchanged with ChatGPT and DeepSeek, we finally decided what to build-my very own open-source RP2040 devboard, officially named Al-Jazarani (don’t ask why, it just sounds cool).

I went through so many project ideas that my brain started buffering. At one point I considered everything from a robot arm to a mini AI computer to “maybe just build my own operating system”. After this long, dramatic struggle with a million browser tabs open at once, random Hackclub projects, and 7 new music genres discovered between scrolling, I landed on something actually possible, cool, and expandable - a custom RP2040 board (I don't even know if I need this but it just sound cool to have it iykyk).

So, I opened the RP2040 devboard schematic from Hackclub, opened up KiCad, and spent maybe 3 or 4 hours following the guide (really useful btw). I’m happy to say that WHY IS THIS TAKING SO LONG THE LAPTOP'S GONNA EXPLODE AND THIS WON'T FINISH.
**✅ What went well:**
	•	Somehow didn’t crash my laptop with 5+ software running in the background and and 60+ Opera tabs open.
	•	Learned how to read power nets like a pro (well… almost).
	•	Got a solid understanding of how the RP2040 handles inputs, power, and USB.
	•	Discovered like 10 new songs that are now stuck in my head.
	•	Found out that I put 3.3V instead of +3V3 before it was too late.

**💀 What didn’t:**
	•	Halfway through, I forgot who am I and started talking to myself.
	•	Realized I have an exam tomorrow 😭.
	•	Too lazy to continue tonight. **IT’S MOVIE TIME 🍿**. No, I'm too lazy to study.
Tomorrow, I’ll continue if my laptop doesn't explode.
WISH ME GOODLUCK FOR THE EXAM!
